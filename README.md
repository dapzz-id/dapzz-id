Hi, I’m Kadavi Raditya Alvino, usually called Davi👋. 
I'm still a student. I'm Student at SMK Telekomunikasi Telesandi Bekasi.
I'm 17 years old now. 
I'm an Indonesian. 
I only master the web and maybe a little mastery of the mobile platform too. 
I once took a course in the duniacoding.id, taking the Fullstack Web Developer with Laravel course,
and I also took a course at codingstudio.id taking a course on Making 2D and 3D Games.
I have also participated in Student Competency Competition (SCC/LKS) activities.
